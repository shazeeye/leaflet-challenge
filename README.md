# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

In this project I helped the United States Geological Survey visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

### Steps

1. Created a new repository for this project called `leaflet-challenge`. 

2. Cloned the new repository to your computer.

3. Pushed the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.


### Level 1: Basic Visualization

Your first task is to visualize an earthquake data set.

1. **Data set**

 Weekly earthquake summariy across the world: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   *  Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

   * Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Created a legend that will provide context for your map data.
